# Rust Sample Code
- Code that can be copy-pasted and ran on https://play.rust-lang.org/

1. Get minimum value in an i32 vec
2. Implement generic enum `SomethingOrNothing`
3. Implement generic `get_minimum()` function for vecs
4. Implement primitive `SinglyLinkedList` stack for i32 numbers
5. Simpler version of `SinglyLinkedList` stack using `Options`
6. a. Version of exercise 5 with explicit [`drops` to avoid recursion that could blow up the stack](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/first-drop.html)
6. b. Entirely the same as exercise 6b more verbose
7. a. Sample of closures and closures in structs
7. b. MEMOIZATION example with `HashMap`
8. Basic `HashMap` usage
